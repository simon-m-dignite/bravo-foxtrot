    text: "Bravo Foxtrot LLC was founded in September 2023 by Brandon Puhlman and Frank Esposito in Canton, GA. Both Brandon and Frank, police officers at the Sandy Springs Police Department, brought their practical experience to the table. The initial concept stemmed from their desire to combat human trafficking and provide better tools for law enforcement officers on the ground. Inspired by the need to create intuitive and reliable technology, they aimed to develop solutions that would allow agencies and officers to communicate and share information more efficiently. Guided by their extensive experience in law enforcement, the founders' vision is to become a leading provider of innovative and effective solutions for the field.",
